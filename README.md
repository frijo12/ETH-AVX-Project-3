# FRIJO ERC-20 Token

## Overview

FRIJO is an ERC-20 token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to offer a versatile and feature-rich token experience. Developed utilizing the OpenZeppelin library, FRIJO adheres to the ERC-20 standard while incorporating additional functionalities for enhanced utility and flexibility.

## Contract Features

### ERC-20 Standard Compliance

FRIJO fully complies with the ERC-20 standard, ensuring seamless integration with a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps), wallets, and exchanges that support ERC-20 tokens.

### Minting Capability

The contract owner possesses exclusive minting privileges, enabling the issuance of new FRIJO tokens to any designated account. This feature grants the owner the flexibility to expand the token supply as necessary.

### Burning Functionality

Token holders have the autonomy to burn their FRIJO tokens, facilitating the removal of tokens from circulation. Burning transactions effectively reduce the total token supply, fostering a controlled token ecosystem.

### Permit Functionality

FRIJO implements the ERC-2612 permit function, empowering users to approve token transfers through a signature mechanism rather than requiring direct transactions. This functionality enhances gas efficiency for specific interactions, streamlining user experience.

## Deployment

The FRIJO contract is successfully deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, with an initial token supply of 10 FRIJO tokens. The contract owner is designated as per the specified initial owner address.
